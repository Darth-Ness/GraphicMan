This is a tool that uses the system package manager to install/uninstall packages. As well as updating all sytem packages.

At the moment it only supports Arch/pacman, but I'm planning on porting it to Debian/Apt.

Want to add a different OS/package manager? Create a pull request!

# Dependencies

Make you have Tkinter installed if you want to use this.
