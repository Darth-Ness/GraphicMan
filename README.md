# GraphicMan
This is a tool that uses the system package manager to install/uninstall packages. As well as updating all sytem packages.

At the moment it only supports Arch/pacman Debian/Apt. I would like to port it to other, but I only have Pacman and Apt at the moment.

Want to add a different OS/package manager? Create a pull request!
Arch users! You can also use this as a AUR helper.
# Dependencies

Make you have Tkinter installed if you want to use this.
